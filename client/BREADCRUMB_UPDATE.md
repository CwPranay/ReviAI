# Breadcrumb Navigation Update

## What Was Added

A proper breadcrumb navigation component has been added to improve user navigation and provide context about the current page location.

## New Component

### `components/Breadcrumb.tsx`

A smart breadcrumb component that:
- Automatically generates breadcrumbs based on the current URL path
- Shows "Home" icon for the root page
- Displays chevron separators between items
- Highlights the current page
- Makes previous pages clickable links
- Uses proper semantic HTML with `<nav>` element

**Features:**
- 🏠 Home icon for root navigation
- ➤ Chevron separators
- 🎨 Styled with Tailwind classes
- 📱 Responsive design
- ♿ Accessible navigation

## Updated Pages

### 1. Upload Page (`/upload`)
**Breadcrumb:** Home > Upload

- Removed the "Back" button
- Added breadcrumb at the top
- Better visual hierarchy
- Cleaner layout

### 2. Editor Page (`/editor`)
**Breadcrumb:** Home > Editor

- Added breadcrumb above the header
- Maintains all existing functionality
- Better navigation context

### 3. Preview Page (`/preview`)
**Breadcrumb:** Home > Preview

- Added breadcrumb at the top
- Removed "Back to Editor" button (breadcrumb provides navigation)
- Added "Resume Preview" heading
- Cleaner, more professional layout

## Visual Example

```
Home > Upload
Home > Editor
Home > Preview
```

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users always know where they are
2. **Easy Navigation**: Click any breadcrumb to go back
3. **Professional**: Standard pattern used in modern web apps
4. **Consistent**: Same navigation pattern across all pages
5. **Accessible**: Proper semantic HTML and ARIA support

## Styling

The breadcrumb uses:
- `text-muted-foreground` for inactive items
- `text-foreground` for the current page
- `hover:text-foreground` for hover states
- Smooth transitions
- Proper spacing with ChevronRight icons

## Code Example

```tsx
import Breadcrumb from '@/components/Breadcrumb';

export default function MyPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Breadcrumb />
      {/* Rest of your page */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Auto-Detection

The breadcrumb automatically:
- Reads the current pathname
- Splits it into segments
- Capitalizes each segment
- Creates clickable links
- Hides on the home page (no breadcrumb needed)

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Custom labels (e.g., "Resume Editor" instead of "Editor")
- Icons for each page type
- Dropdown menus for complex navigation
- Truncation for very long paths

**Status**: ✅ Implemented and working
**Pages Updated**: 3 (Upload, Editor, Preview)
